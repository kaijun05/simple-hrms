<div align='justify'>
This project is a simple Web-Based Human Resource Management System (HRMS) designed to manage employee records efficiently and securely. The system considered three user roles which include <strong>HR Admin</strong>, <strong>Manager</strong>, and <strong>Employee</strong>, where each of them has distinct levels of access and functionalities. For this HRMS, key business requirements involve <strong>scalability</strong> to handle a growing number of employees and departments, <strong>security and compliance</strong> where data must be protected with access control and encryption, <strong>reliability</strong> with minimal downtime, and <strong>remote accessibility</strong> where employees and HR personnel need secure access from different locations. Therefore, to meet these requirements, <strong>AWS services</strong> were selected to enhance security, performance, and scalability. The system includes:
